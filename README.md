# FRONTEND DESIGNS

This is a place where I list all of the designs I've coded personally in order to practice my frontend skills or just try learning new tools.
Pages and solutions I try to recreate are mostly in HTML, CSS and JS. I'm currently trying to hone my SCSS skills, if you have any interesting sites that would be fun to recreate please send them to me.
